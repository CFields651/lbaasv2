# lbaasv2
The documentation for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10 is not very accurate:  

https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openstack_platform/10/html/networking_guide/sec-lbaas    

There is a kbase that is closer but not quite accurate either:  

https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2837871  

The code here should work for:

# rpm -qi openstack-neutron-lbaas  
Name        : openstack-neutron-lbaas  
Epoch       : 1  
Version     : 9.1.0  
Release     : 4.el7ost
